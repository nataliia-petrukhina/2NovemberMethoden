# String methods

## Tasks

### Task 1

Given 2 variables containing strings:

```js
let text = "hello world!";
let animal = "ELEPHANT";
```

Create 2 other variables to save the text transformed to upper case and the animal to lower case.

Print all 4 variables to the console and verify that the original values haven't changed.

Expected output:
```plaintext
hello world!
HELLO WORLD!
ELEPHANT
elephant
```

### Task 2

Given a string containing a date:

```js
let date = "21/06/1983";
```

Use the method `slice()` or `substring()` to save the day, month and year in 3 separate variables.

Then use `console.log()` to get an output as shown below:

```plaintext
Day: 21
Month: 06
Year: 1983
```

### Task 3

Given 4 variables with some strings containing information about a person:

```js
// Task 3

let firstName = "jimmy";
let lastName = "cORRigAn";
let city = "LONDON";
let job = "painter";
```

Use the appropriate string methods to make sure that every word is correctly capitalised.

Reassign the modified values to the same variables and then use `console.log()` to get an output like shown below:

```plaintext
First name: Jimmy
Last name: Corrigan
City: London
Job: Painter
```

### Task 4

Given a variable containing a string:

```js
let word = "JavaScript";
```

Look at the [task-4.js](task-4.js).

Use the appropriate methods and operators to get the right answer to the questions inside the different `console.log()`.

Feel free to add extra variables as needed and add your code next to the question or in a separate `console.log()` right after.

For example:

```js
let string1 = "a";

// solution 1
console.log(`Is the string ${string1} equal to "a"?`, string1 === "a");

// solution 2
console.log(`Is the string ${string1} equal to "a"?`, string1 === "a");
console.log(string1 === "a");
```

**IMPORTANT**: make sure that your solution is case insensitive, so that there's no difference between lower and upper case letters.

### Task 5

Given a string:

```js
let word = "fridge";
```

Look at the file [task-5.js](task-5.js). 

Use the appropriate methods and operators to answer the questions inside the `console.log()`
